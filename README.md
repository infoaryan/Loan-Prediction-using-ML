# Loan-Prediction-using-ML
This is a Machine Learning project which predicts the probability of loan sanctioning.
## Algorithm used:
1. The data is mined and sought for insights.
2. Data is cleaned for any NaN values and Categorial features.
3. Visualizations are made on the data for correlations and other characteristics.
4. Various Models are trained using the splitted data and there respective accuracies are noted.
5. After taking the best base model Ada Boosting is applied with hyper parameter variations to seek the best output.
6. The Precision, Recall and f1-Score of the model are noted and minimised.
